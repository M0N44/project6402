## About the Project  
The 6402 Project is a collaborative initiative to build a digital memorial dedicated to preserving the stories of victims of extrajudicial executions in the context of the Colombian armed conflict.

The name "6402" refers to the number of records in official databases that confirm there are 6402 dead and disappeared people in Colombia from 1970 until today. Other databases estimate over 10,000, and some suggest more than 100,000 victims. This number comes from official sources now used by the JEP (Special Peace Justice Court) to investigate and deliver justice to the victims and the country.

By leveraging tools like Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, our goal is to create an interactive and accessible archive that honors their memory and promotes justice and reconciliation. Our project has been recognized and supported by the [National Center for Historical Memory of Colombia](https://centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/), where we participated in a co-creation lab in November and December 2024, working on an initial prototype of the website. Additionally, the project has been endorsed and recognized by [MAFAPO (Mothers of Victims of Extrajudicial Executions)](https://www.instagram.com/mafapocolombia/?hl=es).

## What We’re Building  
Our digital memorial will include:

- An interactive database of stories and data (we need to pull the official databases to Wikidata and use the Wikimedia projects as the back end for the official memorial site).  
- Visual elements like timelines, maps, and photo galleries (data visualization and front-end design).  
- Open collaboration through Wikimedia platforms (structure data, data contribution, and research to get more information to display on the website).
